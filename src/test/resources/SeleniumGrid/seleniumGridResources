Selenium Grid :
Purposes and main functionalities
●	Central entry point for all tests
●	Management and control of the nodes / environment where the browsers run
●	Scaling
●	Running tests in parallel
●	Cross platform testing
●	Load balancing

Hub
●	Intermediary and manager
●	Accepts requests to run tests
●	Takes instructions from client and executes them remotely on the nodes
●	Manages threads
A Hub is a central point where all your tests are sent. Each Selenium Grid consists of exactly one hub. The hub needs to be reachable from the respective clients (i.e. CI server, Developer machine etc.) The hub will connect one or more nodes that tests will be delegated to.
Nodes
●	Where the browsers live
●	Registers itself to the hub and communicates its capabilities
●	Receives requests from the hub and executes them
Nodes are different Selenium instances that will execute tests on individual computer systems. There can be many nodes in a grid. The machines which are nodes do not need to be the same platform or have the same browser selection as that of the hub or the other nodes. A node on Windows might have the capability of offering Internet Explorer as a browser option, whereas this wouldn’t be possible on Linux or Mac.
 Quick start   1.

Start hub machine  : go to selenium grid folder ( cd Documents/ then cd Selenium_Grid/
 Now copy the command      java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar  -role hub
Then paste it on terminal .again open new terminal and register to the Hub
Paste it   java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="/Users/mdmolla/Downloads/chromedriver"  -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub  and get it from first terminal (    http://192.168.1.3:4444/grid/register    )

 Second Option  paste in a terminal    to  Start up the hub machine : 
java -jar /Users/mdmolla/Documents/Selenium_Grid/selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub
To register the node with  hub open new terminal  paste  : java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="/Users/mdmolla/Downloads/chromedriver" -jar /Users/mdmolla/Documents/Selenium_Grid/selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://192.168.1.2:4444/grid/register  ( http to the end may be changed)
